# Credential vending via a broker socket

## Why a broker (vs the shelf)

The shelf vends one set of short-lived, scoped credentials, read-only, **identical for
every consumer** — the agent and the dev read the same files. That's simple and is
what ships today, but it can't:

- give the **agent a narrower / audited / shorter-TTL grant** than the dev, even though
  both draw on the same upstream authority;
- avoid **at-rest** exposure — shelf files are readable by any process in a consumer
  that mounts them;
- produce a **usage audit** — file reads are invisible.

The broker fixes all three: each consumer talks to **its own socket**, the sidecar
mints **on demand** (nothing at rest), and it can **scope and audit per request**.

## Per-consumer sockets

The sidecar exposes **one socket per consumer**, and **the socket is the policy
boundary** — each is mounted into exactly one consumer container:

- `/creds/dev.sock` → the dev's grants
- `/creds/agent.sock` → the agent's (narrower) grants

A consumer asks for a credential **by name**; what that name resolves to (which
repos/perms/role, what TTL) is decided **in the sidecar**, never by the caller, so a
consumer can't widen its own grant. Because identity is established by _which socket
you can reach_ (mount topology, set by compose), the consumers can share a uid — the
broker does not rely on `SO_PEERCRED` (whose pid is unreliable across namespaces).

## Prototypical config

The grant tables are **baked into the sidecar image** (human-rebuild-gated), **not**
bind-mounted from an untrusted `/workspace` — so changing scope is a reviewed rebuild:

```yaml
# sidecar grants config — baked into the sidecar image. Trusted config.
consumers:
  dev:
    endpoint: { type: unix, path: /creds/dev.sock }
    grants:
      github/myorg:
        {
          kind: github,
          installation_id: '…',
          repos: [opus, aws],
          perms: { contents: write, pull_requests: write },
          ttl: 1h,
        }
      aws/0848…: { kind: aws, profile: 0848…-developer, ttl: 1h }
  agent:
    endpoint: { type: unix, path: /creds/agent.sock }
    grants:
      github/myorg:
        { kind: github, installation_id: '…', repos: [opus], perms: { contents: read }, ttl: 15m, audit: true }
```

Deployers fan this out to as many consumers as they like (a second agent, a CI runner,
a scratch box) — each gets its own socket and grant table.

## Properties

- **Per-consumer scope** — agent read-only / short-TTL, dev read-write, same upstream
  authority.
- **Nothing at rest** — minted on demand, never written to a consumer-readable file.
- **Per-request audit** — every issuance is attributable (the `audit: true` above).
- **No signing capability or upstream authority in any consumer** — it can only request
  what its grant table allows.
- **Accepted residual (unchanged from the shelf):** a consumer fully controls the token
  it's _granted_ (use + network exfil). The broker controls _acquisition_ and _audit_,
  not use — pair with an egress allowlist to blunt exfiltration.

## Sidecar-to-sidecar vending — removing the shared SSO home

The shelf split (`credential-shelf-aws` + `credential-shelf-github`) bootstraps
auth with a shortcut: **both sidecars mount the same home volume**, so one
`aws sso login` populates the SSO cache for both. The cost is that both then hold the
full SSO session — so that split is code/operational modularity, not (yet) a blast-radius
reduction.

The broker removes the coupling. A sidecar is just another **consumer** — so the AWS
sidecar (the sole SSO holder) vends a _narrow_ role to the GitHub sidecar over a socket,
e.g. a grant whose only power is `kms:Sign` on the App key:

```yaml
consumers:
  github-sidecar:
    endpoint: { type: unix, path: /run/devcred-internal/github.sock }
    grants:
      aws/kms-signer: { kind: aws, role: kms-signer-role, ttl: 15m }
```

The GitHub sidecar fetches `aws/kms-signer` on demand and uses it to sign App JWTs. Now
it **never holds the SSO session** — only a ≤1h `kms:Sign` credential; compromise it and
the attacker can sign for an hour, not assume the user's other roles. The SSO session
lives in exactly one container and the shared home disappears.

_(On the shelf this same fan-out is possible by vending the signer role to a private
inter-sidecar volume the consumers never mount — but the socket is cleaner: per-consumer,
on demand, nothing at rest.)_

## Wire protocol

How a consumer fetches over the socket — the `GET <name>` request, the response
payload, transport auto-detection (unix socket / tcp / file shelf / env / none), and
the reserved `SIGN` verb — is specified in [SECRETS.md](./SECRETS.md). The broker is
simply the _socket_ transport of that contract with per-consumer grant tables behind
it; the shelf is the _file_ transport of the same contract.
