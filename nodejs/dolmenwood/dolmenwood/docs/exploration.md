# Exploration Hierarchy

## Expedition

The full undertaking of venturing beyond civilization. An expedition spans the entire time the party is out in the wilds and encompasses all activities performed while abroad.

## Journeys

> inter-hex travel

Long-distance movement from one hex to another. A journey covers the act of traversing the wilds between regions, facing roadside events, weather, and travel hazards.

## Surveys

> intra-hex wilderness exploration

Thorough exploration of a single hex. A survey represents roaming the woods, bogs, and barrows of a region to uncover its secrets, features, lairs, and hidden oddities.

## Delves

> site-scale exploration

Focused investigation of a specific, localized area—ruins, barrows, standing stones, fairy crofts, and other discrete adventure sites within a hex.
