This is a Typescript monorepo built using pnpm and turborepo. Packages are organized in subfolders of the "nodejs" folder in the repository root.

All code should be written using Typescript assuming strict typing compiler options enforced.

We use single quotes and arrow functions whenever possible. Two spaces are used for indentation. We omit semicolons when they are not syntactically required. Please follow these conventions.
